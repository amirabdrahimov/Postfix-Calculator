# Postfix-Calculator
A postfix calculator that works with binary representation of numbers.

The program accepts a mathematical expression in postfix format as input
(one line). The numbers are entered in decimal representation.

- The storage of the postfix expression and the algorithm for calculating the expression are implemented in the Stack data structure.
- The program outputs:
a. binary values of the entered arguments
b. the result of the operation in binary representation
c. the result of the operation in decimal representation
